This archive file contains the comparison set used for the PRODs; it is a superset of that used 
for the Speedies. It contains all 1381 articles from the Speedy comparison set described in the readme file
of the Speedycomparison dataset, as well as an additional 655 articles from another 13 categories,
for a total of 2036 articles; as always, each article is accompanied by its talk page, if it exists.
The articles from the speedy comparison set are in the main folder; the additional ones used only for PRODs
are found in the "more kepts" subfolder and are divided into subfolders by category. 
Some subfolders contain a folder labeled "too large"; the files in
these folders were not used in our experiments but were part of the random selection from each category.

The additional categories used in this set only are:

  American businesspeople
  American child businesspeople
  American local politicians
  Bangladeshi businesspeople
  People involved in direct selling
  Indian actresses
  Indian businesspeople
  Indian footballers
  Indonesian footballers
  Online companies
  Pop bands
  Rock bands
