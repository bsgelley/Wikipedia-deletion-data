This archive file contains a dataset of articles created in December 2012 (Dec. 3 -23, except 14,15, and 16.)
They were downloaded soon after their creation and are therefore mostly short. All of these articles were
later deleted, most within a short period of time from their creation. (For the corresponding articles
created during the same time period that were not deleted, see 
the newkepts.tar.gz file.) The files are organized in folders by creation date. Talk pages that existed
at the time of download are included as well. The folder entitled "Too small" contains articles that
were found to be empty once downloaded, for various reasons. They contain
no content but are included for the sake of understanding article creation and deletion statistics.
