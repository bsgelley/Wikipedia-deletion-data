AfDs.tar.gz contains a set of articles nominated for deletion discussion on the Articles for Deletion page between February 23 and March 22, 2013. 
As above, articles are separated in folders labeled by date (in this case date only), with sub-folders marked "Deleted" for those
articles that were later deleted. Please note that the first two weeks or so of folders do not have Deleted sub-folders because all
the articles in them were downloaded after the articles chosen for deletion had already been deleted.
