This repository contains several datasets available for download. See the individual README files of each dataset for more details. 
To download all datasets directly without using git, see http://bsgelley.github.io/Wikipedia-deletion-data. Please note that
this packages all datasets together in one giant file; it will take some time to download.

1) A dataset of Wikipedia articles nominated for Speedy Deletion from October - December 2011; some of these were later deleted and some were not.
Data is in Speedies.tar.gz; readme in SpeedyREADME.txt.

2) A comparison set of articles that were not deleted from Wikipedia, obtained using Wikipedia's category hierarchy. This is the set that we used
in our Speedy Deletion experiments. The exact method we used to choose these articles can be found in accompanying Descriptiontxt file.
Data is in SpeedyComparison.tar.gz; readme in SpeedycompREADME.txt. 

3) A set of 847 Wikipedia articles Proposed for Deletion, or PROD'ed, from October-December 2011.
This set also includes 141 articles PROD'ed in March 2013. Data is in PRODs.tar.gz, readme in PRODsREADME.txt.

4) The comparison set used for the PRODs; it is a superset of that used for the Speedies. It contains all 1381 articles from
 the Speedy comparison set described above, as well as an additional 655 articles from another 13 categories for a total of 2036 articles.
 The exact extra categories used are listed in the README file for this dataset. Data is in PRODscomparison.tar.gz, readme in 
 PRODscompareREADME.txt.
 
5)A set of articles nominated for deletion discussion on the Articles for Deletion page between Feb 23 and March 22, 2013.
Some of these were later deleted and some were not; these are separated and marked. Data is in AFD.tar.gz; readme is in AfDREADME.txt.

6) A set of pages created in December 2012 that were downloaded shortly after creation that were later deleted. Data in alldels.tar.gz, 
readme in alldelsREADME.txt.

7) A (much larger) set of pages created in December 2012 that were downloaded shortly after creation and were not deleted within 
the time horizon (one week) that we chose. Data is in newkepts.tar.gz, readme in newkeptsREADME.txt.
